Bunch of projects that I found interesting 
1) Newton's fractals show how numbers in the complex plane behave erratically(kind of like your mom) and small changes in the input range spit out a dramatically different results. Like if you start with an initial point one millionth of a centimetre away, it tends to a totally different root. It's surreal how chaos comes out of seeminlgy mundane computations.

2) The Mandelbrot and the Julia sets are almost the poster child of math and need no introduction. The fascinating part of the julia sets is that they predate computers. I can almost imagine nerds painfully checking if a point in space blows up or not on a Saturday night. With the insane computation power we have at our fingertips, you'd think we'd know why the chicken crossed the road but nope, no progress on that one. Yet another win for the chickens. 

3) The fourier transform. If I had a penny for everytime I had a sleepless night thinking of why this very code won't work, I'd have two pennies. 

F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \cdot e^{-i\omega t} \, dt
