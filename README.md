Bunch of projects that I found interesting. 
**Newton's fractals.**  
Newton's fractals show how numbers in the complex plane behave erratically(kind of like your mom) and small changes in the input range spit out a dramatically different results. Like if you start with an initial point one millionth of a centimetre away, it tends to a totally different root. It's surreal how chaos comes out of seeminlgy mundane computations.  

**Mandelbrot and Julia sets.**  
The Mandelbrot and the Julia sets are almost the poster child of math and need no introduction. The fascinating part of the julia sets is that they predate computers. I can almost imagine nerds painfully checking if a point in space blows up or not on a Saturday night. With the insane computation power we have at our fingertips, you'd think we'd know why the chicken crossed the road but nope, no progress on that one. Yet another win for the chickens.  

**The complex fourier transform.**   
The fourier transform. If I had a penny for everytime I had a sleepless night thinking of why this very code won't work, I'd have two pennies.  

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \cdot e^{-i\omega t} \ dt
$$

This seemingly daunting equation produces wonderfully intricate results out a bunch of rotating vectors. Although very intimidating, 3Blue1Brown has a wonderfully explained video about the subject. Infact the inspiration of this whole thing comes from him. 10/10 highly recommend. 

Working with the fourier transform is kind of like contacting your ex again. You'll never know what you're going to get. Sometimes there are these wonderful shapes that make you believe that yes maybe there is a purpose for you, but other times it's just a few jagged lines and a crashed program making you question if it was ever the simple equation you once knew and loved very dearly. 
    
Despite all the pain, suffering and the descent into the deep abyss of nihilism it has caused; the fourier transform is truly a wonderful mathematical tool that can transform a jumbled mess of signals into pure waves. I wish there was a fourier transform for people.
